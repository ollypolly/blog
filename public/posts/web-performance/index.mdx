## Performance Matters

Website performance directly impacts user experience and business metrics. Here's what I've learned about optimization.

### Core Web Vitals

The three key metrics to focus on:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Loading performance
2. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Interactivity
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Visual stability

### Optimization Techniques

#### Image Optimization
```html
<img 
  src="image.jpg" 
  alt="Description"
  loading="lazy"
  width="800" 
  height="600"
/>
```

#### Code Splitting
```javascript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

Small improvements in performance can lead to significant gains in user satisfaction and conversion rates.
