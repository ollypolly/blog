## Why TypeScript Matters

TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern JavaScript development. Here are some patterns that have transformed my coding experience.

### Advanced Types

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  data: T;
  status: 'success' | 'error';
  message?: string;
};

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const fetchUser = async (id: number): Promise<ApiResponse<User>> => {
  // Implementation here
};
```

### Utility Types

- `Partial<T>` - Makes all properties optional
- `Pick<T, K>` - Creates a type with selected properties
- `Omit<T, K>` - Creates a type without specified properties

These patterns have saved me countless hours of debugging.
