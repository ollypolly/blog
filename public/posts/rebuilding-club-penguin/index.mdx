## Growing Up

Like most people who grew up in the early naughties, online games were the forging of my childhood.

The year is 2005, and as soon as I could get online with my chunky off-white monitor, trackball mouse and dial up connection, I discovered flash games, and eventually Miniclip. This inevitably led me to discover two games that proved pivotal to mine and many other kids childhoods, Club Penguin and RuneScape.

From here me and my twin sister religiously played both games, discovering fan sites like [Club Penguin Gang](http://www.clubpenguingang.com/) - run by the notable penguin - Mimo777.

Disney recklessly took down Club Penguin in 2019 - with the intent to replace it with the now defunct Club Penguin Island, a phone app.
