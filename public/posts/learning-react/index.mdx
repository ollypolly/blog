## Getting Started with React

React has evolved significantly over the years. Here's what I've learned about modern React development...

### Key Concepts

- **Hooks**: The foundation of functional components
- **State Management**: From local state to global solutions
- **Component Composition**: Building reusable UI pieces

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

The journey continues as React keeps evolving with new features and patterns.
