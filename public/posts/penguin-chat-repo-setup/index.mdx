## Creating the Turborepo

We'll start by scaffolding a new Turborepo.

```
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
```

## Adding the apps/packages

By default, it includes `@penguin-chat/web`, `@penguin-chat/ui`, `@penguin-chat/docs`, `@penguin-chat/eslint-config` and `@penguin-chat/typescript-config`.

We want to add a types package, an api package, along with an entities package.
