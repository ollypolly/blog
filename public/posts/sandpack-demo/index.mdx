# Interactive Penguin Chat Progress

This is a test of how I can show interactive progress on my Club Penguin chat remake. Users can edit the code and see changes live!

## Static Preview

Here's what the chat component looks like when rendered:

<PenguinChat />

## Interactive Demo

Now you can edit the code and see changes live:

<PenguinChatDemo />

## Try These Experiments:

1. **Change the theme**: Modify the CSS colors to make it look more like the original Club Penguin
2. **Add emotes**: Try adding emoji support or penguin-specific emotes 
3. **Message styling**: Add different colors for different usernames
4. **Sound effects**: Add a beep sound when messages are sent (hint: use `new Audio()`)

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll show:
- Real-time messaging with WebSockets
- Penguin avatars and animations  
- Room switching functionality
- Moderation and safety features

This interactive format lets you play with the code as I document the rebuild process!
