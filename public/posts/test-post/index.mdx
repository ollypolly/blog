## Hello MDX Blog

This is a blog post written in **MDX**. You can add React components inline, or even entire interactive widgets.  
The goal here is to test **length**, **formatting**, and **syntax highlighting** in a realistic way.

## Section 1: Basic Markdown

Here’s some text with **bold**, *italics*, ~~strikethrough~~, and [a link](https://example.com).  
We can also do blockquotes:

> This is a blockquote. It should render nicely in your design.  
> It can span multiple lines and contain **emphasis**.

## Section 2: Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

1. Ordered item one
2. Ordered item two
3. Ordered item three

---

## Section 3: Code Blocks

Inline code looks like `const x = 42;`.

And here’s a bigger example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
