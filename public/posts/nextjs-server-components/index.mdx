## Server Components Revolution

React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we think about React applications, and Next.js has made them accessible.

### What Are Server Components?

Server Components run on the server and send rendered HTML to the client, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

```jsx
// This runs on the server
async function PostList() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts(); // Direct database access
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <PostCard key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Benefits

- **Zero JavaScript Bundle**: Server Components don't add to client bundle
- **Direct Backend Access**: No need for API routes for data fetching
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Components are naturally split
- **SEO Friendly**: Content is server-rendered by default

### Client vs Server Components

```jsx
// Server Component (default)
async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('/api/data');
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}

// Client Component (explicit)
'use client';
function ClientComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

The future of React development is looking very exciting with these new patterns.
